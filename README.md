# ezsh
ezsh (Read EasyShell) is a simple shell written in C.
The main purpose of developing this shell is to acquaint oneself with the linux manual,
writing solid C code and learning about the basic functionality of the shell. 

The shell will implement basic functionality such as ls, cd, mkdir, rm, echo and many more.
The main inspiration for this project will be a project described in William Stallings' "Operating Systems, 7th ed".
